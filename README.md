## notes
the real idea here is to show the transformation that happens from plain mobilenet embeddings, via a trained TM model layer.

eg, https://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/convnetjs/demo/classify2d.html but for the TM model you made, so you can see how your model's layer warps the mobilenet space

but need to shake the tires on umap a bit more first
